slide title: Effective Programs

      10 Years of Clojure

          Rich Hickey

```

I feel like a broken record every time I start these talks by thanking
everybody.  So I want to start this talk in a different way by saying,
"My son is getting married today."

[Audience applause]

"In another state."

[Audience laughter]

So right after I give this talk, I am going to hop on a plane, go do
that.  I will be back tomorrow morning.  So I have not disappeared.  I
am looking forward to the follow-up talks and everything else, but I
will be missing in action briefly.

So now, to be redundant.  Thanks everybody for coming.  Ten years ago,
Clojure was released, and there is no possible way

[Audience applause]

I could have imagined this.  I told my wife Steph, "If 100 people use
this, that would be ridiculously outrageous".  And that is not what
happened.  And what did happen is interesting.  I do not think it is
fully understood.

But I wanted today to talk about a look back a little bit about the
motivations behind Clojure.  It is not like when you come out with a
programming language you can tell that whole story.  I think one:
because it is not good marketing, and two: because if you really want
to be honest, you probably do not know.  It takes time to understand
what happened, and why, and what you really were thinking.  And I will
not pretend I had a grand plan that incorporated everything that ended
up becoming Clojure.  It certainly involved a lot of interaction with
people in the community.

But, there is this.  "Clojure is opinionated".  We hear this.  And I
think it is interesting to think about two aspects of that.  One is,
in which ways is it?  And what does it mean for a language to be
opinionated?  I think in Clojure's case, people come to it, and they
are like "Wow.  This is forcing me, everywhere I turn, to do something
a certain way".

And I think the nice way to say that is: there are only a few strongly
supported idioms, and a lot of support for them.  So if you use the
stuff that comes with it, there is a whole story that supports your
efforts.  And if you want to fight against that, we do not do too
much.

[Alex was asking me which glasses were the right ones and "neither" is
the answer.]

But design is about making choices.

[Time 0:02:53]

```
slide title: Clojure is 'opinionated'

+ How so?
  + Few, strongly supported idioms
  + Choices made
+ Why?
  + Pain of experience
```

And there are a bunch of choices in Clojure.  In particular, there is
a big choice about what to leave out.  And part of this talk will be
talking about what was left out.

The other side of being opinionated is, "How do you get opinionated?"
I mean it is not like I am opinionated.

[Audience laughter]

Of course I am opinionated, and that comes from experience.  When I
started


[Time 0:03:16]

```
slide title: Application Development

+ scheduling systems (C++)
+ broadcast automation (C++, Java)
+ audio fingerprinting and recognition (C++)
+ yield management (Common Lisp producing SQL)
+ more scheduling (Common Lisp -> C++)
```

doing Clojure in 2005, I had already been programming for 18 years.
So I had had it.  I was done.  I was tired of it.  But I had done some
really interesting things with the languages that professional
programmers used at the time.

So primarily I was working on scheduling systems in C++.  These are
scheduling systems for broadcasters.  So radio stations use scheduling
systems to determine what music they play.  And it is quite
sophisticated the way that works.  You think about "well over the
course of the day you do not want to repeat the same song".  You
actually have to think about the people who listen to the radio for
one hour in the morning and this other hour in the afternoon.  And you
create sort of an alternate time dimension for every drive time hour.
Things like that.  So there is multi-dimensional scheduling and we
used evolutionary program optimization to do schedule optimization.

Broadcast automation is about playing audio.  And at the time we were
doing this, playing audio on computers was a hard thing.  It required
dedicated cards to do the DSP work.

I did work on audio fingerprinting.  So we made systems that sat in
closets and listened to the radio, and wrote down what they heard.
And this was both used to track a station's playlist, and then
eventually to track advertising, which was where the money was for
that.  Which involved figuring out how to effectively fingerprint
audio and scrub audio, sort of compare novelty to the past.

[Time 0:04:59]

I worked on yield management systems.  Does everybody know what "yield
management" is?  Probably not.  So what do hotels, airlines, and radio
stations have in common?  Their inventory disappears as time passes.
"Oh, I have a free room.  I have got a slot in my schedule.  I have
got a seat on this airplane."  And then time passes and nobody bought
it, and now you do not.

So yield management is the science and practice of trying to figure
out how to optimize the value of your inventory as it disappears out
from under you.  And that is about looking at the past and past sales,
and it is not simplistic.  So for instance, it is not an objective to
sell all of your inventory.  The objective is to maximize the amount
of revenue you get from it, which means not selling all of it in most
cases.

That was not written in C++.  That was around the time I discovered
Common Lisp, which was about 8 years into that 15 years.  And there
was no way the consumer of this would use Common Lisp, so I wrote a
Common Lisp program that wrote all the yield management algorithms
again out as SQL stored procedures and gave them this database, which
was a program.

Eventually I got back to scheduling, and again wrote a new kind of
scheduling system in Common Lisp, which again they did not want to run
in production.  And then I rewrote it in C++.  Now at this point I was
an expert C++ user and really loved C++, for some value of love

[Audience laughter]

that involves no satisfaction at all.

[Audience laughter]

But as we will see later I love the puzzle of C++.  So I had to
rewrite it in C++, and it took four times as long to rewrite it as it
took to write it in the first place.  It yielded five times as much
code, and it was no faster.  And that is when I knew I was doing it
wrong.


[Time 0:07:09]

```
slide title: Application Development (2)

+ US national exit poll, election projection system (C#)
+ Clojure (Java, Clojure)
+ machine listening, artificial cochlea (Common Lisp,
  Mathematica, C++, Clojure)
+ Datomic database (Clojure)
```

I went on to help my friend Eric write the new version of the National
Exit Poll System for the U.S., which also involves an election
projection system.  We did that in a sort of self-imposed functional
style of C#.

And then around 2005, I started doing Clojure and this machine
listening project at the same time.  And I had given myself a 2-year
sabbatical to work on these things, not knowing which one would go
where.  And leaving myself free to do whatever I thought was right.
So I had zero commercial objectives, zero acceptance metrics.  I was
trying to please myself for two years.  I just sort of bought myself a
break.

But along the way during that period of time, I realized I would only
have time to finish one.  And I knew how to finish Clojure, and
machine listening is a research topic.  I did not know if I was two
years away or five years away.  So Clojure is written in Java and
eventually the library is written in Clojure.

And the machine listening work involved building an artificial
cochlea, and I did that in a combination of Common Lisp and
Mathematica and C++.  And in recent years as I have dusted it off, I
have been able to do it in Clojure, and that is sort of the most
exciting thing.  I needed these three languages before to do this and
now I only need Clojure to do it.

And then I did Datomic, which was also Clojure.


[Time 0:08:39]

```
slide title: Databases!

+ ISAM
+ SQL
+ RDF
+ LWW (?)
```

Almost all of these projects involved a database.  All different kinds
of databases, from ISAM databases, a lot of SQL, many attempts but not
many integrations of RDF.  Databases are an essential part of solving
these kinds of problems.  It is just what we do.

How many people use a database in what they do every day?  How many
people do not?  OK.

So this last thing [LWW] is not an acronym for a database.  It is
there to remind me to tell this anecdote.

So I used to go to the Light-Weight Languages workshop.  It was a
one-day workshop held at MIT where people working on small languages,
either proprietary or just domain-specific, DARPA or whatever, would
talk about their little languages, and what they were doing with
little languages.  It was very cool and very exciting.  Got a bunch of
language geeks in the same room, and there was pizza afterwards.

So I remember, I would just go by myself or with my friend.  I was not
part of the community that did that.  They just let me in.  But
afterwards, they had pizza.  So I sat down at pizza with two people I
did not know, and I still do not know their names.  And it is good
that I do not, because I am going to now disparage them.

[Audience laughter]

They were both computer language researchers.  And they were talking,
also disparagingly, about their associate, who had somehow fallen in
with databases and lost the true way.  And one of them sort of
sneeringly went to the other and said, "Aw, David, when was the last
time you used a database?".  And he was like, "I do not know that I
have ever used a database."

And like I sort of choked on my pizza, because theoretically they are
designing programming languages.  And yet they are programming, and
they never use databases.  I did not know how that worked.

But it was part of the inspiration to do 


[Time 0:10:38]

```
slide title: 'Situated' Programs

  situate - "to put in or on a particular site or place"

+ execute for extended periods of time - often continuously
+ deal with information
+ have time-extensive 'memory'
  + remember/recall from databases
+ deal with real-world irregularity
```

Clojure because, if people who do not do databases can write
programming languages, _anybody_ can.

[Audience laughter]

So there are different kinds of programs.  And one of the things I
tried to capture on this slide is to talk about what those kinds of
programs were that I was working on.  And the word I came up with were
"situated" programs.  In other words, you can distinguish these kinds
of programs that sit in the world and are sort of entangled with the
world.  They have a bunch of characteristics.

One is: they execute for an extended period of time.  It is not just
like calculate this result and spit it over there.  It is not like a
lambda function at AWS.  These things run on an ongoing basis, and
they are sort of wired up to the world.  And most of these systems run
continuously, 24/7.  It is quite terrifying to me that now these
things, which are 30 years old, are almost definitely still running
24/7 somewhere, if they have not been replaced.  So this first notion
of extended periods of time means continuously, as opposed to just for
a burst.

They almost always deal with information.  What were the kinds of
things that I talked about?  Scheduling.  In scheduling you look at
what you have done in the past.  You look at your research data.  What
does your audience tell you they like, or they are interested in, or
what they are burnt out on?  And you combine that knowledge to make a
schedule.

Yield management looks at the past sales, and sales related to
particular periods of time, and facts about that, and produces pricing
information.

The election system looks at prior vote records.  How did people vote
before?  That is a big indicator of how they are going to vote again.
Of course the algorithms behind that are much more sophisticated.

But in a simplified way, you can say all of these systems consumed
information.  And it was vital to them.  And some of them produced
information.  They tracked the record of what they did.

[Time 0:12:35]

And that is this next point, which is that most of these systems have
some sort of time-extensive memory.  That database is not like an
input to the system that is fixed.  It is something that gets added to
as the system runs.  So these systems are remembering what they did.
And they are doing it both for their own consumption, and for
consumption by other programs quite often.

And they deal with real-world irregularity.  This is the other thing I
think that is super-critical in this situated programming world.  It
is never as elegant as you think, the real world.

And I talked about that scheduling problem of: there is linear time,
somebody who listens all day, and there is somebody who listens just
while they are driving in the morning and the afternoon.  Eight hours
apart there is one set of people, and then an hour later there is
another set of people, and another set.  You have to think about all
that time.

You come up with this elegant notion of multi-dimensional time, and be
like, "Oh, I am totally good ... except on Tuesday".  Why?  Well, in
the U.S., on certain kinds of genres of radio, there is a thing called
"two for Tuesday".  So you built this scheduling system, and the main
purpose of the system is to never play the same song twice in a row,
or even pretty near when you played it last.  And not even play the
same artist near when you played the artist, or else somebody's going
to say, "All you do is play Elton John.  I hate this station".

But on Tuesday, it is a gimmick.  "Two for Tuesday" means, every spot
where we play a song, we are going to play two songs by that artist,
violating every precious elegant rule you put in the system.  And I
have never had a real-world system that did not have these kinds of
irregularities.  And where they were not important.


[Time 0:14:28]

```
slide title: 'Situated' Programs (2)

+ interact with other systems
+ often interact with humans
+ remain in use for long periods of time
+ are situated in a changing world
+ use other people's code
+ _not compilers_
```

Other aspects of situated programs.  They rarely are sort of their own
little universe where they get to decide how things are, and they do
not need to interact with anyone else or agree with anyone else.
Almost all these systems interacted with other systems.

Almost all of these systems interacted with people.  Somebody would
sit there and say, "start playing this song right now", or "skip this
song", and we are like "I scheduled that song, and I balanced
everything around you playing it, and now your DJ just said 'do not do
that'".

The election projection system has _tons_ of screens for users to look
at things, and cross-tabulate things, and make decisions, feeding all
the things you see on TV, so people can explain things to other
people.  So people, and talking to people, is an important part of
these programs.

They remain in use for long periods of time.  These are not throw-away
programs, like I said.  I do not know that much of the software I ever
wrote has stopped being run by somebody.  People are still using it.

And they are also situated in a world that changes.  So again, your
best laid plans are there the day you first write it, but then the
rules change.  May be there is "three for Thursdays".  I do not know,
but when that happens, go change everything to deal with it.

Another aspect of being situated, and it is one I have been thinking
about a lot more recently is, being situated in the software
environment and community.  Your program is rarely written from
scratch, with all code that you wrote just for the purpose of the
program.  Invariably, you are going to pull in some libraries.  And
when you do, you have situated yourself in that library ecosystem.
And that is another thing.

So when I talk about situated programs, and you look at the programs I
talked about having written in my career, one of them really sticks
out, right?  What is that?

[Time 0:16:21]

Clojure.  Compilers, they are not like this.  They do not have a
fraction of these problems.  They take some input right off the disk.
They get to define the whole world, right?  When you write a language,
what do you do?  The first thing you do when you write a language, you
get rid of any "two for Tuesdays".

[Audience laughter]

Right?  You can just disallow it.  You try to make the most regular
thing.  And then your programming is just, well, now I have to enforce
the rules that I made up for myself.  It is like, wow, what could be
easier than that?

[Audience laughter]

And it really is a lot simpler.  They do not generally use a database.
Although I think they probably should.  They rarely talk over wires
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So compilers and theorem provers
and things like that are not like these programs.


[Time 0:17:08]

```
slide title: Effective

    producing the intended or expected result

from Latin effectus "accomplishment, performance"
```

So the title of this talk is "Effective Programs".  And what does
"effective" mean?  It means "producing the intended result".  And I
_really_ want this word to become important, because I am really tired
of the word "correctness", where "correct" just means, I do not know,
"made the type checker happy".

[Audience laughter]

None of my consumers of these programs that I did professionally care
about that.  They care that the program works, for their definition of
"works".

On the other hand, I do not want this to be taken as, "this is a
recipe for hacking", just like "do anything that kind of works".  So
we have to talk about what "works" means.  What does it mean to
actually accomplish the job of being effective.


[Time 0:17:51]

```
slide title: What is Programming About?

+ making computers effective in the world
+ how are we effective in the world?
  + leverage experience to generate predictive power
  + enabling good decisions and successful activities
+ experience == information == facts about things that actually happened
```

And that is where I want to sort of reclaim the name "programming".
Or at least make sure we have a broad definition that incorporates
languages like Clojure and the approaches that it takes.  Because I
think these problems matter.

So what is programming about?  I am going to say, for me, "programming
is about making computers effective in the world".  And I mean
"effective" in the same way we would talk about _people_ being
effective in the world.  Either the programs themselves are effective,
or they are helping people be effective.

Now, how are we effective?  Well, sometimes we are effective because
we calculate really well.  Like maybe when we are trying to compute
trajectories for missiles or something like that.

But mostly not.  Mostly areas of human endeavor.  We are effective
because we have learned from our experience, and we can turn that
experience into predictive power.  Whether that is knowing not to step
in a giant hole or off a cliff, or walk towards the roaring lion, or
how to market to people, or what is the right approach to doing this
surgery, or what is the right diagnosis for this problem.

People are effective because they learn, and they learn from
experience and they leverage that.  And so, I am going to say, "being
effective is mostly not about computation, but it is about generating
predictive power from information".

And you have heard me talk about information.  It is about facts.  It
is about things that happened.  Experience, especially when we start
pulling this into the programming world, experience equals
information, equals facts about things that actually happened.  That
is the raw material of success.  In the world, it is for people.  It
should be for programs that either support people, or replace people,
so they can do more interesting things.


[Time 0:19:45]

```
slide title: What is Programming _Not_ About?

+ itself - that's mathematics

mathematics may be defined as the subject in which
   we never know what we are talking about, nor
        whether what we are saying is true

-- Bertrand Russell


+ just algorithms/computation
```

So I will also say that, for me, "what is programming not about?"  It
is not about itself.  Programming is not about proving theories about
types being consistent with your initial propositions.  It is not.
That is an interesting endeavor of its own.  But it is not what I have
been talking about.  It is not the things I have done in my career.
It is not what programming is for me, and it is not why I love
programming.  I like to accomplish things in the world.

Bertrand Russell has a nice snarky comment about that.  He is actually
not being snarky.  He wants to elevate mathematics and say, "it is
quite important that mathematics be only about itself".  If you start
crossing the line, and standing on stage and saying, "mathematical
safety, type safety equals heart machine safety", you are doing
mathematics wrong, according to Bertrand Russell.

And it is not just algorithms and computation.  They are important,
but they are a subset of what we do.


[Time 0:20:46]

```
slide: 

[ rectangle containing the word "Logic" ]
```

So, do not get me wrong.  I like logic.  I have written those
scheduling systems.  I have written those yield management algorithms.
I have written a Datalog engine.  I like logic.  I like writing that
part of the system.  I usually get to work on that part of the system.
That is really cool.


[Time 0:21:03]

```
slide: 

[ Now there is a circle around the square, just barely surrounding the
square. ]
```

But even a theorem prover, or a compiler, eventually needs to read
something from the disk, or spit something back out, print something.
So there is some shim of something other than the logic.  But in this
world of situated programs, and the kinds of programming that I have
done, and I think that Clojure programmers do,


[Time 0:21:25]

```
slide: 

[ Now the square is smaller, occupying only a small fraction of the
area of the circle.  The square is no longer labeled "Logic", because
the text would be unreadably small.  The circle contains the text
"Information Processing". ]
```

that is a small part of the program.  Programs are _dominated_ by
information processing.  Unless they have UIs, in which case, there is
this giant circle around this, where this looks like a dot.

[Audience laughter]

But I am not going to go there.

[Audience laughter]

Actually, because I do not do that part.  But the information
processing actually dominates programs both in the effort ...  The
irregularity is often there.  It is this information part that takes
all the irregularity out of the way, so my Datalog engine can have an
easy day, because everything is now perfect, because I see a perfect
thing, because somebody fixed it before it got to me.

And I do not want to make light of this.  I think this is
super-critical.  Your best [TBD] Google's coolest search algorithm, if
they could not get it to appear on a web page and do something
sensible when you type something and pressed enter, no one would care.
This is where the value proposition of algorithms gets delivered.  It
is super important.  But in my experience,


[Time 0:22:32]

```
slide: 

[ Square moved to bottom right of enclosing "Information Processing"
circle, and became a smaller fraction of circle's area then previous
slide. ]
```

while this is the ratio [jump back to previous slide] it probably
needs to be to solve the problem, this is the ratio [jump forward to
slide with circle being a larger fraction of everything] it often is,
and was in my experience in my work.

[ His point: Not only was the information processing part the largest
part of the program, it was larger than it should have been. ]

Actually, this is also sort of bigger.  The square would be more of a
dot.  That the information part of our programs is _much_ larger than
it needs to be, because the programming languages we had then, and
still have mostly, are _terrible_ at this.  And we end up having to
write a whole ton of code to do this job.  Because it is just not
something the designers of those languages took on.


[Time 0:23:05]

```
slide: 

[ Now add several ovals labeled "Libraries" to bottom left of
"Information Processing" circle. ]
```

And of course we are not done.  We do not write programs from scratch,
so we have to start dealing with libraries.  When we do that, now we
have started to cross out of "we get to define everything" land.  Now
we have


[Time 0:23:17]

```
slide: 

[ Same as previous picture, but with dotted lines indicating
dependencies from Information Processing code to Libraries, and from
the "Logic" square to to Libraries. ]
```

relationships.  And we have to define how we are going to talk to
libraries, and how they may talk to us, but mostly we talk to them.
So now there are lines.  There is some protocol of how do you talk to
this library.  And we are still not


[Time 0:23:30]

```
slide: 

[ Now add a line with arrows in both directions, between the
"Information Processing" circle to/from a box labeled "Database". ]
```

done.  Because we said these situated programs, they involve
databases.  Now, while the information processing and the logic and
the libraries may have all shared a programming language -- or at
least on the JVM, something like the JVM, a runtime -- now we are out
of that.  Now we have a database that is clearly over there.

It is written in a different language.  It is not colocated in memory,
so there is a wire.  It has its own view of the world, and there is
some protocol for talking to it.

And invariably, whatever that protocol is, we want to fix it.

[Audience laughter]

And why is that?  Well it is something I am going to talk about later
called "parochialism".  We have adopted a view of the world our
programming language put upon us, and it is a misfit for the way the
database is thinking about things.  And rather than say, "I wonder if
we are wrong on our end?" we are like, "Oh no, we have got to fix
that.  That relational algebra, it cannot possibly be a good idea".


[Time 0:24:36]

![00.24.36 Three or More...](EffectivePrograms/00.24.36.png)

OK, but we are still not done.  I said these programs, they do not sit
by themselves.  They talk to other programs.  So now, we have three or
more of these things.  And now they may not be written in the same
programming language.  They all have their view of the world.  They
all have their idea of how the logic should work.  They all have their
idea of how they want to talk to libraries or use libraries.  And
there are more wires and more protocols.

And _here_ we do not get the database vendor at least giving us some
wire protocol to start with, that we will fix with ORM.  We have to
make up our own protocols.  And so we do that.  And what do we end up
with?  JSON, right?  It is not good.

But at least now

[Time 0:25:20]

![00.25.20 System](EffectivePrograms/00.25.20.png)

we have something ...  So when I program, this is what I am
programming.  This is a program, to me.  This is going to solve a
problem, and no subset of this is going to solve the problem.  This is
the first point you start solving the problem.  But you are not done
with problems ...

[Time 0:25:38]

![00.25.38 System + Time](EffectivePrograms/00.25.38.png)

Because it is not a one-shot, one-time, one-moment, one great idea,
push the button, ship it, move on, kind of world, is it?  Every single
aspect of this mutates over time.  The rules change.  The requirements
change.  The networks change.  The computing power changes.  The
libraries that you are consuming change.  Hopefully the protocols do
not change, but sometimes they do.  So we have to deal with this over
time.  And for me, effective programming is about doing this, over
time, well.


[Time 0:26:18]

```
slide title: Different Strokes

You'll get a different language if you're writing:

+ compilers, theorem provers
+ device drivers
+ phone switches
+ information-driven situated programs

What are _you_ doing?
```

So I am not trying to say, "there is a right and wrong way, and
Clojure is right and everything else is wrong".  But it _should_ be
apparent, and maybe it is not, because I think we all aspire to write
programming languages that are general purpose.  You could probably
write a theorem prover in Clojure.  Actually, I am sure you could.

But you certainly would get a different language if your target were
compilers and theorem provers, or your target were device drivers, or
phone switches.  Clojure's target is information-driven situated
programs.  There is not a catchy phrase for that.  But that is what I
was doing.  All my friends were doing that.  How many people in this
room are doing that?  Yeah.  So when you look at programming
languages, you really should look at: what are they for?  There is no
inherent goodness.  There are suitability constraints.

![00.27.19 The Problems of Programming](EffectivePrograms/00.27.19.png)

So before I started Clojure, I drew this diagram ... Which I did not.
That would have been an amazing feat of prescience.  But as I try to
pick apart what was Clojure about -- because I think there is no
reason to write a new programming language unless you are going to try
to take on some problems.  You should look at what the problems are.
I mean, why was I unhappy as a programmer after 18 years and said, "if
I cannot switch to something like Common Lisp, I am going to switch
careers".  Why am I saying that?  I am saying it because I am
frustrated with a bunch of limitations in what I was using.

And you can call them problems, and I am going to call them the
problems of programming.  I have ordered them here in terms of
severity.  And severity manifests itself in a couple of ways.  Most
important, cost.  What is the cost of getting this wrong?  At the very
top you have the domain complexity, about which you could do nothing.
This is just the world.  It is as complex as it is.

But the very next level is where we start programming.  We look at the
world and say, "I have got an idea about how this is, and how it is
supposed to be, and how my program can be effective about addressing
it".  And the problem is, if you do not have a good idea about how the
world is, or you cannot map that well to a solution, everything
downstream from that is going to fail.  There is no surviving this
misconception problem.  And the cost of dealing with misconceptions is
incredibly high.

So then there is this 10x, a full order of magnitude reduction in
severity, before we get to this set of problems I think are more in
the domain of what programming languages can help with.  And because
you can read these, they are all going to come up in a second as I go
through each one on some slide, so I am not going to read them all out
right now.

But importantly, there is another break where we get to _trivialisms_
of problems in programming.  Like typos and just being inconsistent.
Like, you thought you are going to have a 
strings and you put
a number in there.  That happens.  People make those kinds of
mistakes.  They are pretty inexpensive.

I have marked with _ are highlighted in green on the slide. ]

So what were the problems that Clojure took on?  These green ones.
And again I will go through all the green ones in a moment, but I
would say, amongst the ones in the middle, I do not think that Clojure
tried to do something different about resource utilization than Java
did.  It sort of adopted that runtime and its cost model.

I wanted Clojure to be a good library language, but I did not think
about the library ecosystem problems as part of Clojure.  And my talk
last year about libraries implies that I still think this is a big
problem for programs.  It is one of the ones that is left, right?
After you do Clojure and Datomic, what is left to fix?

[Audience laughter]

And the libraries are there.  But the inconsistency and typos, not so
much.  I mean we know you can do that in Clojure.  It is actually
pretty good at letting you make typos.


[Time 0:30:46]

```
slide title: Clojure Design Objectives

+ can we create effective, situated programs out of substantially
  simpler stuff?
+ with low cognitive load from language
+ make a Lisp I can use instead of Java/C#
```

So fundamentally, what is Clojure about?  Can we make programs out of
simpler stuff?  I mean, that is the problem.  After 18 years of using
C++ and Java, you are exhausted.  How many people have been
programming for 18 years?  OK.  How many for more than 20 years?  More
than 25?  Fewer than 5?  So that is really interesting to me.  It may
be an indictment of Clojure as a beginner's language, or it may be
that Clojure is the language for cranky, tired, old programmers.

[Audience laughter and applause]

And you know what?  I would not be embarrassed if it was.  That is
fine by me.  Because I did make it for myself, which I think is an
important thing to do.  Trying to solve other people's problems, and
think you understand what they are, that is tricky.

So when I discovered Common Lisp, having used C++, I said that, "I am
pretty sure the answer to this first question is, 'yeah, absolutely'".
And can we do that with a lower cognitive load?  I also think, "yes,
absolutely".  And then the question is, "can I make a Lisp I can use
instead of Java or C#?"  Because you just heard my story, and I used
Common Lisp a couple of times, and every time it got kicked out of
production.  Or just _ruled_ out of production, really not kicked out.
It did not get a chance.  So I knew I had to target a runtime that
people would accept.


[Time 0:32:23]

```
slide title: Meta problems

+ acceptability
  + performance
  + deployment platform
+ power
  + leverage
  + compatibility
```

So there are these meta problems.  You can try to take on some
programming problems, but there are always problems in getting a
language accepted.  I did not think Clojure would get accepted.
Really, honestly.

But I knew, if I wanted my friend, who thought I was crazy even doing
it, person number one other than myself to try it, I would have to
have a credible answer to the acceptability problems and the power
problems.  Because otherwise it is just not practical.  It is like,
"That is cool Rich, but, like, we have work to do".

[Audience laughter]

"If we cannot use this professionally, really it is just a hobby".  So
we have acceptability, I think that goes to performance, and for me, I
thought it was also the deployment platform.

There is a power challenge that you have to deal with, and that is
about leverage and I will talk about that later.  And also
compatibility.  Again that is part of acceptability.  But Clojure's
ability to say "it is just a Java library, kind of", was big.  How
many people snuck Clojure into their organization to start with?
Right, OK.  Success!

[Audience laughter]


[Time 0:33:33]

```
slide title: Non-problems

+ Lisp syntax (parentheses)
+ Few static type checks
```

And then there were other things I considered to be _absolute_
non-problems.  And the first of these is the parentheses.  How many
people ...  and it is OK to admit, right?  Everybody has a story.  How
many people thought the parentheses were going to be a problem and now
think that was crazy thinking?  Yeah.  Which is fine, I think
everybody goes through that.  Everybody looks at Lisp and is like,
"this is cool but I am going to fix this part before I get going.
Before I start, before I understand the value proposition of it at
all, I am going to fix this", and that says something about
programmers.  I am not sure exactly what.

[Audience laughter]

But I do not believe this is a problem, and in fact when we get to the
middle of this talk you will see that I think this is the opposite of
a problem.  This is the core value proposition of Clojure.  And I
think things like, par-make-it-go-away, whatever that is, it is a
terrible idea.  And it is not good for beginners to do that, to try to
solve a problem that is a feature.

The other thing I considered not a problem is it being dynamic.  I
worked in C++.  We had a thing where we said in C++ is that, "if it
compiles it will probably work".  Like they say of Haskell.  And it
was equally true then as it is now.

[Audience laughter]

But we really did believe it!  We totally did.  And it does not help.
It really does not help for the big problems.  The top, the big wide
ones.


[Time 0:35:04]

```
slide title: PLOP - Place Oriented Programming

#1 self-inflicted programming problem

+ Make FP the default idiom
+ immutable persistent data structures the default
  + Bagwell's HAMT made persistent, 1-2x read, 2-4x write
+ large library of pure functions
+ immutable local bindings
```

OK, so problem number one on that list was place oriented programming.
Absolutely, this is the problem.  Almost all the programs I wrote,
lots of the things on that list were multi-threaded programs.  They
are crazy hard in C++.  Just impossible to get right, when you adopt a
normal mutability approach, mutable objects.  So, this is the number
one self-inflicted programming problem.  It seemed clear to me that
the answer was to make functional programming and immutable data the
default idiom.

So the challenge I had was: were there data structures that would be
fast enough to say, "we could swap this for that"?  And the goal I had
was to get within 2x for reads and 4x for writes.  And I did a lot of
work on this.  This was actually the main research work behind
Clojure, was about these persistent data structures.

And eventually I found ... I looked at Okasaki's stuff and the _fully_
functional approach, and none of that gets here.  And then I found
Bagwell's structures, which were not persistent, but I realized could
be made so.  And they just have tremendously great characteristics,
combining the persistence with the way they are laid out, the way
memory works.  They made it.  They made this bar, and I was able to
get my friend to try my programming language.

And we have this large library of pure functions to support this, and
immutable local bindings.  Basically if you fall into Clojure, your
first hurdle is not the parentheses, right?  It is this functional
paradigm.  Everything is gone.  There is no mutable variables.  There
is no state.  There are no mutable collections and everything else.
But there is a lot of support.  There is a _big_ library.  You just
have to sort of learn the idioms.  So I think this was
straightforward.

The critical thing that is different about Clojure is, by the time I
was doing Clojure, the people who invented this stuff had adopted a
lot more.  I think most of the adherents in the functional programming
community considered functional programming to be about _typed_
functional programming.  Statically typed functional programming _is_
functional programming.

And I do not think so.  I think that this falls clearly in the 80/20
rule.  And I think the split here is more like 99/1.  The value props
are all on this side, and I think Clojure users get a sense of that.
They get a feel for that.  _This_ is the thing that makes you sleep at
night.


[Time 0:37:47]

```
slide title: Information

+ sparse
+ open
+ incremental/accumulative
+ names capture semantics
+ (should be) composable
```

OK, problem number two -- and this is the most subtle problem.  This
is the thing that annoys me the most about statically typed languages
-- is they are terrible at information.  So let us look at what
information is.  Inherently, information is sparse.  It is what you
know.  It is what happened in the world.  Does the world fill out
forms, and fill everything out for you?  All the things you would like
to know?  No!  It does not.  It does not, and "not ever" is probably
more correct.

The other thing is, "what can you know?"  What are you allowed to
know?  There are no good answers to that.  Whatever you want, right?
It is open.  What else is there?  What _is_ there to know?  Well I
mean, what time is it, right?  Because every second that goes by,
there is more stuff to know, more things happen, more facts, more
things happen in the universe.  So information accretes, it just keeps
accumulating.

What else do we know about information?  We do not really have a good
way of grappling with it, except by using names.  When we deal with
information as people, names are super-important.  If I just say,
"47", there is no communication going on yet.  We have to connect it.

And then the other big thing, and this is the thing I struggle with so
often.  I have a system.  I made a class or a type about some piece of
data.  Then over here, I know a little bit more data than that.  Do I
make _another_ thing that is like that?  If I have derivation, do I
derive to make that other thing?  What if I am now in another context
and I know part of one thing and part of another thing.  What is the
type of part of this and part of that?  And then there is this
explosion.

But of course these languages are doing this wrong.  They do not have
composable information constructs.


[Time 0:39:44]

```
slide title: The Information Programming Problem

+ classes and algebraic types are terrible for this
  + names not there, or not first class
  + no compositional algebra
  + aggregates determine semantics
    + not how information works
  + yield information 'concretions'
```

So what is the problem with programming in a way that is compatible
with information?  It is that we elevate the _containership_ of
information to become the semantic driver.  We say, "this is a person,
and a person has a name, and a person has an email, and a person has a
social security number", and there is no semantics for those three
things except in the context of the person class or type, whatever it
is.

And often, depending on the programming language, the names are either
not there.  If you have got these product types where it is like,
"person is string x, string x, int x, string x, string x, int x, float
x, float", product type.  Like, a complete callous disregard for
people, names, human thinking.  It is crazy.

Or your programming language maybe has names, but they compile away.
They are not first class.  You cannot use them as arguments.  You
cannot use them as look-up vectors.  You cannot use them as functions
themselves.

There is no compositional algebra in programming languages for
information.  So we are taking these constructs that I think were
there for other purposes.  We have to use them because it is all we
were given, and it is what is idiomatic.  Take out a class, take out a
type, and do this thing.

But the most important thing is that the aggregates determine the
semantics, which is dead wrong.  If you fill out a form, nothing about
the information you put on that form is semantically dominated by the
form you happen to fill out.  It is a collecting device.  It is not a
semantic device, but it becomes so.

And what happens is you get these giant sets of concretions around
information.  People that write Java libraries, you look at the Java
Framework.  It is cool.  It is relatively small, and everything's
about sort of mechanical things.  Java's good at mechanical things --
well, mechanisms.

But then you hand the same language to the poor application
programmers who are trying to do this information situated program
problem, and that is all they have got.  And they take out a class for
like everything they need, every piece, every small set of information
they have.  How many people have ever seen a Java library with over
1500 classes?  Yeah, everybody.

And this is my experience.  In my experience, it does not matter what
language you are using.  If you have these types, and you are dealing
with information, you are going to have a proliferation of
non-composable types, that each are a little parochialism around some
tiny piece of data that does not compose.  And I am really not happy
with this.

In programming literature, the word "abstraction" is used in two ways.
One way is just like, "naming something is abstracting".  I disagree
with that.  Abstracting really should be drawing from a set of
exemplars some essential thing.  Not just naming something.  And what
I think is actually happening here is we are getting not data
abstractions, you are getting data concretions.

Relational algebra, that is a data abstraction.  Datalog is a data
abstraction.  RDF is a data abstraction.  Your person class, your
product class, those are not data abstractions.  They are concretions.


[Time 0:43:24]

```
slide title: Clojure and Information

'just use maps'
+ first class, functional associative data structures
+ maps are functions of keys, keywords/symbols fns of maps
+ generic library (algebra, composition, etc)
+ names are first-class, namespace-qualified
+ associating semantics with attributes, not aggregates
```

So we know in practice, Clojure says, "just use maps".  What this
meant actually was, "Clojure did not give you anything else", right?

[Audience laughter]

There was nothing else to use.  There were no classes.  There was not
a thing to say deftype.  There were not types.  There was not
algebraic data types, or anything like that.

There were these maps, and there was a huge library of functions to
support them.  There was syntactic support for it.  So working with
these associative data structures was tangible, well-supported,
functional, high-performance activity.

And they are generic.  What do we do in Clojure if we have just some
of the information here and just some of the information there, and we
need both those things over there?  We say, "what is the problem?"
There is no problem.  I take some information, some information, and I
merge them, I hand it along.  If I need a subset of that, I take a
subset of that.  I call "select-keys" and I get a subset.  I can
combine anything that I like.  There is an algebra associated with
associative data.

The names are first class.  Keywords and symbols are functions.  They
are functions of associative containers.  They know how to look
themselves up.  And they are reified, so you can tangibly flow them
around your program and say, "pick out these three things" without
writing a program that knows how to write Java or Haskell pattern
matching to find those three things.  They are independent of the
program language.  They are just arguments.  They are just pieces of
data.  But they have this capability.

And the other thing, which I think is a potential of Clojure -- it is
realized to varying degrees, but the raw materials for doing this are
there -- is that we can associate the semantics with the attributes,
and not with the aggregates.  Because we have fully qualified symbols
and keywords.  And obviously spec is all about that.


[Time 0:45:23]

```
slide title: Brittleness/coupling

+ flowing type information and structure major source of coupling
+ positional semantics, parameterization _don't scale_

Clojure emphasizes
+ dynamic typing, no burden of proof
+ open constructs, runtime polymorphism
+ open maps, need-to-know, accept and propagate more
```

All right, brittleness and coupling.  This is another thing that is
just my personal experience: that static type systems yield much more
heavily coupled systems.  And that a big part of that time aspect of
the final diagram of what problem we are trying to solve, is dominated
by coupling when you are trying to do maintenance.  Flowing type
information is a major source of coupling in programs.  Having pattern
matching of a structural representation in a hundred places in your
program is coupling.  Like, this stuff, I am seizing up when I see
that.  The sensibilities you get after 20 years of programming, you
hate coupling.  It is like the worst thing, and you smell it coming
and you want no part of it.  And this is a big problem.

The other thing I think is more subtle, but I put it here because
unless you see this, is positional semantics do not scale.  What is an
example of positional semantics?  Argument lists.  Most languages have
them, and Clojure has them, too.  Who wants to call a function with 17
arguments?  Nope.

[Audience laughter]

There is one in every room.

[Audience laughter]

Nobody does.  We all know it breaks down.  Where does it break down?
Five, six, seven?  At some point, we are no longer happy.  But if that
is all you have, if you only have product types, they are going to
break down every time you hit that limit.

How many people like going to the doctor's office and filling out the
forms.  Don't you hate it?  You get this big lined sheet of paper that
is blank.  Then you get this set of rules, that says, "put your social
security number on line 42, and your name on line 17".  That is how it
works, right?  That is how the world works.  That is how we talk to
other people?  No!  It does not scale.  It is not what we do.  We
always put the labels right next to the stuff and the labels matter.
But with positional semantics we are saying, "No, they don't.  Just
remember the third thing mean this, and the seventh thing means that".

[Time 0:47:29]

And types do not help you.  They do not really distinguish this, float
x, float x, float x, float x, float ...  At a certain point, it is not
telling you anything.  So they do not scale but they -- it occurs in
other places, so we have argument lists.  We have product types.
Where else?  Parameterization.  Who has seen a generic type with more
than 7 type arguments in C++ or Java?  Yeah, we tend not to see it in
Java because people give up on parameterization.

[Audience laughter]

And what do they switch to?  Spring!

[Audience laughter]

No, I mean, that is not a joke.  That is just a fact.  They switched
to a more dynamic system for injection.  Because parameterization does
not scale.  And one of the reasons why it does not scale is: there are
no labels on these parameters.  They may get names by convention, but
they are not properly named.  When you want to reuse the type with
parameters, you get to give them names

[audio cut off, only for a few seconds]

again.  Just like in pattern matching.  That is terrible.  That is a
terrible idea.  And it does not scale.

So anywhere positionality is the only thing you have got, you are
eventually going to run out of steam.  You are going to run out of the
ability to talk to people, or they are going to run out of the ability
to understand what you are doing.

[Time 0:48:59]

So I think types are an anti-pattern for program maintenance and for
extensibility, because they introduce this coupling and it makes
programs harder to maintain, and even harder to understand in the first
place.

So Clojure is dynamically typed.  You do not have this burden of
proof.  You do not have to prove that, because I made something here
and somebody cares about it over there, every person in the middle did
not mess with it.  Mostly, they do not mess with it.  I do not know
what we are protecting against, but we can prove now that they are
still strings over there.

The constructs are open.  We much prefer runtime polymorphism, either
by multi-methods or protocols, to switch statements, pattern matching,
and things like that.

The maps are open.  They are need-to-know.  What do we do in Clojure
if we do not know something?  We just leave it out.  We do not know
it.  There is no maybe this, maybe that.  If you actually
parameterized the information system, it would be maybe everything.
Maybe everything no longer is meaningful.  It just isn't.

And nothing is of type maybe something.  If your social security
number is a string, it is a string.  You either know it or you don't.
Jamming those two things together, it makes no sense.  It is not the
type of the thing.  It may be part of your front-door protocol, that
you may need it or not.  It is not the type of the thing.

So the maps are open.  We deal with them on a need-to-know basis and
you get into the habit of propagating the rest.  Maybe you handed me
more stuff.  Should I care?  No.  The UPS truck comes and my TV is on
the truck.  Do I care what else is on the truck?  No.  I do not want
to know.  But it is OK that there is other stuff.


[Time 0:50:54]

```
slide title: Language Model Complexity

+ reserve brains for domain problems, not meta-puzzles
+ Clojure is just (functional core of) Lisp
  + small!
+ execution model akin to Java
```

So the other problem is language model complexity.  C++ is a very
complex language, and so is Haskell, and so is Java, and so are most
of them.  Clojure is very small.  It is not quite Scheme small, but it
is small compared to the others.  And it is just the basic lambda
calculus kind of thing with immutable functional core.  There are
functions.  There are values.  You can call functions on values and
get other values.  That is it.  There is no hierarchy.  There is no
parameterization.  There is no existential types, blah blah blah blah
blah.

And the execution model is another tricky thing.  We are getting to
the point, even in Java, where it gets harder and harder to reason
about the performance of our programs, because of resources.  And that
is unfortunate.  At least one of the nice things about C was: you knew
if your program crashed, it was your problem.  And you just figure it
out.  But you knew what it was going to take up in RAM, and you could
calculate things, and it was quite tractable.

And that matters to programmers.  Programming is not mathematics.  In
mathematics you can swap any isomorphism for any other.  In
programming you get fired for doing that.

[Audience laughter]

It is different.  Performance matters.  It is part of programming.  It
is a big deal.  So making this something at least I could say, "it is
like Java, and blame them".

[Audience laughter]

Well it is fine.  But it also meant all the tooling helped us.  All
the Java tooling works for Clojure.  How many people use YourKit and
profilers like that on Clojure?  That is pretty awesome to be able to
do that.


[Time 0:52:43]

slide title: Parochialism - names

RDF got it right

  RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying
  schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas
  over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.

+ subject/predicate/object
  + semantics associated with the predicates/attributes, named by URIs
```

[ One dictionary's definition of "parochialism": a limited or narrow
outlook, especially focused on a local area; narrow-mindedness". ]

Now we are into the real nitty-gritty of things I did not like, and
therefore I left out.  This type thing, it goes everywhere.  And the
name I came up for it is "parochialism".  This idea that "I have this
language, and it is got this cool idea about how you should think
about things.  You should think about things using algebraic data
types.  Or you should think about things using inheritance".

It yields this intense parochialism.  You start to have
representations of things, manifestations of representations of
information that they only make sense in the context of this
language's rules for things.  And they do not combine with anybody
else's ideas.  You smash against the database.  You smash against the
wire.  You smash against this other programming language, because you
have got this idiosyncratic, local view of how to think about things.

RDF did this right.  And they did it because they had this objective.
They are trying to accomplish something.  We want to be able to merge
data from different sources.  We do not want the _schemas_ to dominate
the semantics.  How many people have ever gotten the same piece of
mail from the same company and been like, "What is wrong with your
databases, dudes?"  Yeah.  What is wrong?

What is wrong is, one company bought another company.  Now they are
the same company.  They now have these two databases.  In one
database, your name is in the person table, and in another database
your name is in the mailing list table.  Who knows that mailing list
table name and person name are actually the same piece of information?
Nobody.  They have to have meetings.  I mean this is a big dollar --
this is a big ticket problem.  It is not a small ... It is not a
laughing matter, right?

[Audience laughter, after Rich started laughing first]

These big companies have giant jobs trying to merge these systems,
because table parochiality, it is the same as classes and algebraic
data types.  It is the same problem.  It is not a different problem.
It is all like, I had this view of the world, and on the day I decided
how the world is, I decided that names were parts of person, and you
decided that names were parts of mailing lists.  And now we need to
fix this.  And you know how a lot of those companies fix it?  They
introduce a third database, usually an RDF database, as a federation
point, so they now can figure out these two things are the same.  And
eventually they will stop sending you the same piece of mail twice.

So there is a subject, predicate, object, and obviously you can see
the influence of this on Datomic.


[Time 0:55:30]

slide title: Parochialism - types and contexts

+ The more elaborate the type system, the more parochial the types
+ Encourage tyranny of the container
  + Are SSN, email really 'owned' by some class/type?
+ :keys are similar, context needed for interpretation
+ Thwarts info composition
+ Raises bar for program-manipulating programs
```

But it goes further.  I would say that the more elaborate your type
system is, the more parochial your types are.  The less general they
are, the less transportable they are, the less understandable by other
systems they are, the less reusable they are, the less flexible they
are, the less amenable to putting over wires that they are, the less
subject to generic manipulation that they are.

Almost every other language that deals with types encourages this
tyranny of the container I talked about before.  We have a choice in
Clojure, I think people go either way.  There are two things, one is
the container dominates, the other is just sort of the notion of
context dominating the meaning, like, "because I called it this in
this context, it means that".

But we have the recipe in Clojure for doing better than that, in which
you use namespace-qualified keys.  With namespace-qualified keys we
now can merge data and know what things mean, regardless of the
context in which they are used.

And anything about this thwarts the composition I talked about before.

And in particular, because we are pointed at this
program-manipulating-program idea, as you will see later, it makes
this harder.

+ (optionally) namespace qualified - org.myorg/myname
+ reversed domain name system, independent of per-lang
  modules/namespaces/packages
+ aliases to make it easy to do the right thing
```

So Clojure has names that are first class.  This is stuff that was in
Lisp.  It just dominates more because they became the accessors for
the associative data type.  They are functions in and of themselves.
Keywords being functions is sort of the big deal.

They do not disappear.  They are not compiled away into offsets.  We
can pass them around.  We can write them down.  A user who does not
know Clojure can actually type one into a text file and save it, and
do something meaningful with our program without learning Clojure.

We have this namespace qualification.  If you follow the conventions
-- which unfortunately a lot of Clojure libraries are not yet doing --
of this reversed domain name system, which is the same as Java's, all
Clojure names are conflict-free, not only with other Clojure names,
but with Java names.  That is a _fantastically_ good idea, and it is
similar to the idea in RDF of using URIs for names.

And the aliases help make this less burdensome.  And we have done some
more recently to do more with that.

slide title: Distribution

+ what goes over wires?
  + very basic data types - maps of scalars/vectors/maps
+ program inside as you do outside
```

Then there is this distribution problem.  And here is where I start
saying, "Taking a language-specific view of program design is a
terrible mistake", because you are in that little box.  You are
ignoring this big picture.  As soon as you step back, now you have
this problem.  You have to talk over wires.  How many people use
remote object technology?  I am really sorry.

[Audience laughter]

Because it is brutal.  It is very brutal.  It is incredibly brittle
and fragile and complex and error-prone and specific.  How many people
use that kind of technology to talk to people not under their own
employ?  No, it does not work.  That is not how the Internet works.
Distributed objects failed.  The Internet is about sending plain data
over wires.  And almost everything that ever dealt with wires only
succeeded when it moved to this.

And this is very successful.  Why should we program in a way that is
all super-parochial if we only need to eventually represent some
subset of a program -- maybe a subset we did not know in advance --
over wires.  If we program this way all the time, we program the
inside of our programs as "let us pass around data structures", and
then somebody says, "Oh, I wish I could put half of your program
across a wire, or replicated over six machines", what do we say in
Clojure?  That is great.  I will start shipping some edn across a
socket and we are done.  As opposed to, you have got to do everything
over.

slide title: Runtime tangibility

+ Smalltalk
+ Common Lisp
+ the JVM
+ Situated sensibilities
```

So there were plenty of inspirations and examples for me of this.
Runtime tangibility is one of the things I really got excited about
when I learned Common Lisp coming from C++.  Smalltalk and Common Lisp
are languages that were obviously written by people who were trying to
write programs for people.  These are not language theoreticians.  You
can tell.  They were writing GUIs.  They were writing databases.  They
were writing logic programs, and languages also.  But there is a
system sensibility that goes through Smalltalk and Common Lisp that is
undeniable.

And when you first discover them, especially if you discover them late
as I did, it is stunning to see.  And I think it is a tradition that
has largely been lost in academia.  I just do not see the same people
making systems _and_ languages together.  They have sort of split
apart.  And that is really a shame, because there is so much still
left to pilfer from these languages.

They were highly tangible.  They had reified environments: all the
names you could see, you could go back and find the code.  The
namespaces were tangible.  You could load code at runtime.  I mean,
one thing after another after another.

And the old Perlis quip about, "Any sufficiently large C or C++
program has a poorly implemented Common Lisp", is so true.  Again,
Spring, right?  As you get a larger system that you want to maintain
over time, and deal with all those complexities that I showed before,
you want dynamism.  You _have_ to have it.  It is not like an optional
thing.  It is necessary.

[ By "the old Perlis quip" Rich is probably referring to Philip
Greenspun's tenth rule of programming:

"Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad-hoc,
informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of
Common Lisp."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule

Alan Perlis undeniably has some great quotable quotes about
programming, too.  One of the most commonly quoted ones, related to
Clojure, is number 9 from the list at the link below: "It is better to
have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on
10 data structures."

https://web.archive.org/web/19990117034445/http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html ]

But what was particularly interesting for me in implementing Clojure
was how much runtime tangibility and situated sensibilities were in
the JVM design.  The JVM is actually a _very_ dynamic thing.  As much
as Java looks like say, C# or C++, the JVM, it was written with an
idea of "We are going to embed these programs on set top boxes, and
network them, and need to send code around that you could update their
capabilities".  That is like, it is situated everywhere you turn.  And
the runtime has got a ton of excellent support for that.  Which makes
it a great platform for languages like Clojure.

And thank goodness that the work that the people did on Self, and it
did not die, that it actually got carried through here.  Not
everything did.  But it is quite important.  And it will be a sad day
when somebody says, "Well let us just replace the JVM with some static
compilation technology".  And I will tell you, targeting the JVM and
the CLR, it is plain: the CLR is static thinking and the JVM is
dynamic thinking.

So there is situated sensibilities in all of these.

```

![01.02.36 Epochal time model](EffectivePrograms/01.02.36.png)

The other thing you need is some language for dealing with state
transitions.  And that is the epochal time model.  I am obviously not
going to get into this again here, but I have given talks about this
before.  So Clojure has this.  And it was a combination of those
things that let me say, "I think I have a reasonable answer for my
friend".  If he says, "How can I write a real program with this?", I
can say, "Here is how you can write a real program, including a
multi-threaded program, and not go crazy".

So there is lots of stuff I wanted to take from Lisp, and I think I
talked about a lot of these.  It is dynamic.  It is small.  It had
first class names.  It is very tangible.  There is this code is data,
and read/print, and I am going to talk a little bit more about that.

```

But there is the REPL.  And I think that still people are like, "the
REPL is cool because I get to try things".  And that is true, but the
REPL is _much_ cooler than that.  It is cooler than that, because it
is an acronym.  And it is cooler than that because _read_ is its own
thing.  And what Clojure did by adding a richer set of data
structures, is it made read/print into a super power.  It was not just
a convenience.  It is not just a way to interact with people.  It is
not just a way to make it easy to stream programs around, or program
fragments around.

It is now like, "Here is your free wire protocol, for real stuff".
How many people ever sent edn over a wire?  Yeah.  How many people
like the fact that they do not need to think that is a possibility.
They can just do it?  And if they want to switch to something else,
you can.  But it is a huge deal.

Eval obviously we know, it lets us go from data to code.  And that is
the source of macros, but I think again, it is much bigger than the
application to macros.

And finally there is print, which is just the other direction.

+ built on concretions
  + (mutable) cons cell, lists
+ lists are kinda functional, read/print, other data structures are not
+ everything is not a list
  + lists are weak data structures
+ packages/interning
```

But Lisp had a bunch of things that needed to be fixed, in my opinion.
It was built on concretions.  A lot of the design of more abstractions
and CLOS and stuff like that came after the underpinnings.  The
underpinnings did not take advantage of them, so if you want
polymorphism at the bottom, you have to retrofit it.  If you want
immutability at the core, you need something different from the ground
up.  And that is why Clojure was worth doing, as opposed to trying to
do Clojure as a library for Common Lisp.

The lists were functional, kind of, mostly by convention.  But the
other data structures were not.  You had to switch gears to go from
assoc with lists to a proper hash table.

And lists are crappy data structures.  Sorry, they just are.  They are
very weak.  And there is no reason to use them as a fundamental
primitive for programming.

And also packages and interning were very complex there.

So the edn data model is not like a small part of Clojure.  It is sort
of the heart of Clojure.  It is the answer to many of these problems.
It is tangible.  It works over wires.  It is not incompatible with the
rest of the world.  Do other languages have maps?  Associative data
structures and vectors and strings and numbers?  So it seems like a
happy lingua franca.  And why shouldn't we use the lingua franca in
our program?  Why should we have a different language?  It is actually
not that much better, and you have to keep translating.

[ Link is to video of talk "Adventure with Types in Haskell" by Simon
Peyton Jones ]

Simon Peyton Jones, in an excellent series of talks, listed these
advantages of types.  Because this is the big thing that is left out
of Clojure.  There are no types.

They guarantee the absence of certain kinds of errors, which is true.
And he would say -- he does say -- "This is the least benefit of
static typing".

They serve as a partial machine-checked specification, and "partial"
is the operative word here.  It is very partial.

They are a design language.  They help you think.  You have a
framework in which you can think about your problems.

They support interactive development like IntelliSense.

But the biggest merit, he says, is in software maintenance.


[Time 1:06:47]

```
slide title: But...

+ Not the big errors, testing still dominates real-world effectiveness
+ Names dominate semantics and always will -
  foobar :: [a] -> [a]
+ OmniGraffle > UML, design systems (db/wire) not just programs
+ Intellisense, perf optimization - yep, types help
+ Maintenance - overcoming coupling they create
```

And I really disagree with just a lot of this.  It has not been my
experience.  The biggest errors are not caught by these type systems.
You need extensive testing to do real-world effectiveness checking.

Names dominate semantics.  a to a [in Haskell syntax: a -> a], list of
a to list of a [in Haskell syntax: [a] -> [a]].  It means nothing.  It
tells you nothing.  If you take away the word "reverse", you don't
know anything.  You really don't.  And to elevate this to say, "Oh,
this is an important thing.  We have all these properties".  It is not
true.  It just is not true.  There are thousands of functions that
take a list of a and return a list of a.  What does that mean?  It
means nothing.

And checking it ... I mean, if you only had a list of a's, where are
you going to get something else to return?  I mean, obviously you are
going to return a list of a-s, unless you are getting stuff from
somewhere else.  And if you are functional, you are not.

How many people like UML?  How many people have ever used a UML
diagramming tool?  It is not fun, right?  It is like, "No, you cannot
connect that to that".  "Oh no, you have to use that kind of arrow".
"No, you cannot do this".  "No, you cannot...".  It is terrible.
OmniGraffle is much better.  Draw whatever you want.  What are you
thinking about?  Draw that.  What is important?  Write that down.
That is how it should work.

Yes, IntelliSense is much helped by static types.  And performance
optimization, which he did not list, but I think this is one of the
biggest benefits.  We love that in C++.

And maintenance, I think it is not true.  I think that they have
created problems that they now use types to solve.  Oh, I
pattern-matched this thing 500 places and I want to add another thing
in the middle.  Well thank goodness I have types to find those 500
places.  But the fact was: that thing I added, nobody should have
cared about about except the new code that consumed it.  And if I did
that a different way, I would not have had to change anything except
the producer and the consumer, not everybody else who could not
possibly know about it, right?  It is new.

A logical theory may be tested by its capacity for

physical science

```

So I mean for young programmers, if everybody's tired and old, then
this does not matter any more.  But when you are young, you have got
lots of free space.  I used to say "an empty head", but that is not
right.  You have a lot of free space available, and you can fill it
with whatever you like.  And these type systems, they are quite fun,
because from an endorphin standpoint, solving puzzles and solving
problems is the same.  It gives you the same rush.  Puzzle solving is
really cool.

But that is not what it should be about.

I think that this kind of verification and whatnot, it is incredibly
important, but it should be a la carte.  Depending on what you need to
do, depending on the amount of money you have to spend, depending on
what you want to express, you should be able to pull different kinds
of verification technology off the shelf, and apply it.  It should not
be built in.  There is a diversity of needs.  There is a diversity of
approaches of doing it, and a diversity of costs.

In addition, I think to the extent these tools can be pointed at the
system level problem, and not some language parochialism, you get more
bang for your buck.  How many people have used spec to spec a wire
protocol?  Yeah.  There is going to be a lot more of that going on.
And I will not talk much more about spec, but the next version will
increase programmability.

slide title: Information vs Logic

+ We can't explain how to drive a car or play Go
+ Information-trained brains
+ Human-written bodies (manipulable programs)
  + Via which brains _see_ and _act_
+ Real-world safety is going to come from experience, not proof
```

So finally, information versus logic.  The bottom line is, "Where are
we going in programming?"  The fact is, we actually do not know how to
drive a car.  We cannot explain how to drive a car.  We cannot explain
how to play Go.  And then, therefore we cannot apply traditional logic
to encoding that and make a program that successfully does it.  We
just cannot do it.  We are approaching problems in programming now
that we do not know how to do.  We do not know how to explain how to
do.  Like, we know how to drive a car, but we do not know how to
_explain_ how to drive a car.

And so we are moving to these information-trained brains.  Deep
learning and machine learning, statistical models and things like
that.  You use information to drive a model that is full of
imprecision and speculation, but that is still effective because of
the amount of data that was used to train it at making decent
decisions, even though it also could not explain necessarily how it
works.

These programs, though, are going to need arms and legs and eyes.
When you train a big deep learning network, does it get its own data?
Does it do its own ETL?  No.  It does not do any of that.  When it has
made a decision about what to do, how is it going to do it?  Well,
when we get to Skynet, it will not be our problem anymore.

[Audience laughter]

But for right now, it is.  And I think it is quite critical to be
working in a programming language that is itself programmable, that is
amenable to manipulation by other programs.  It will be fun to use
Clojure to do brain building.  But it will also be useful to be able
to use Clojure for information manipulation and preparation, as well
as to use Clojure programs and program components as the targets of
action of these decision-making things.

In the end, real-world safety is going to come from experience.  It is
not going to come from proof.  Anybody who gets on stage and makes
some statement about type systems yielding safe systems, where "safe"
mean real-world?  That is not true.

So, I am going to emphasize that we write programmable programs, and
that Clojure is well-suited to that.  We have a generic way to
represent information and emphasis.  We have a generic way to compose
arguments without adopting the type system.  It is hard enough to
drive a car.  If you have to understand monads too, it is just not
going to work.

A reified system is subject to dynamic discovery, and I think spec
combined with the rest of Clojure being reified is a great way to make
systems that other systems can learn about, and therefore learn to
use.  And of course we have the same ability to enhance our programs
over time.

about your programming language.  We all get infatuated with our
programming languages.  But you know what?  I am actually pretty
skeptical about programming languages being the key to programming.  I
do not think they are.  They are a small part of programming.  They
are not the driver of programming.
